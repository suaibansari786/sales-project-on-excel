# sales-project-on-excel
 In this project, I developed an interactive sales dashboard using Excel, analyzing various aspects of sales and profitability to gain valuable business insights. The dashboard features multiple visual elements and slicers for intuitive data filtering.

Key Features:
Sales over Sub-Categories:

Analyzed sales performance across different product sub-categories.
Used bar charts to compare sales volumes.
Profit Over Year:

Created a line chart to show the trend of profit over the years, highlighting key periods of growth or decline.
Top 10 Sales States:

Identified and ranked the top 10 states by sales.
Used a ranked list or bar chart to visualize the top-performing states.
Total Sales & Total Profit:

Displayed total sales and total profit as key performance indicators (KPIs) at the top of the dashboard for quick reference.
Sales by Month:

A line chart was used to show monthly sales trends, allowing for seasonality analysis.
Slicers for Year and Category:

Implemented slicers to filter data by year and category, making the dashboard interactive and easy to explore.
Tools Used:
Excel: For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.
Pivot Tables: Used to aggregate data and summarize key metrics.
Charts: Various charts (line, bar) were used to visualize sales and profit trends.
